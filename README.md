# Social Pomodoro
Social Pomodoro app is designed for the users that work or study alone. It is highly challenging to keep focusing and concentration while working/studying alone. Social Pomodoro app serves an online library area for the users studying together like real library does.

## Online Working & Studying Area
We -people- are social animals and most of us are more comfortable and are easily encouraged while doing something together. Being in a social area can help us to do more work, increase efficiency and productivity. So, most of the people have difficulty on online education or remote work because of the lack of social area. 

For freelancers, one of the biggest difficulty is working alone. For addressing this, many coworking companies are founded and they begin to serve an inspiring, comfortable social zones for the freelancers.

The situation is nearly the same with online education. The students need to be in a contact with other students. Studying and learning process is easier for them if they are in classes, schools and libraries. The Social Pomodoro app gives to all students and freelancers a silent but social room like libraries. The users can join a studying room and see how many people are in and how much time they are studying. It gives an opportunity to compare the own studying time and others studying time. We do this via pomodoro numbers..

## Pomodoro Technique
Pomodoro is an effective time management technique that gives 25 minute of working session and 5 minute of resting session. With that technique, the people can keep their concentrations in 25 minute working session and they can be more productive in a limited time. In Social Pomodoro app, after joining a room, the users can see how many pomodoro session is completed for each of the users in studying room. There is a kind of leaderboard for each studying room, and it motivates the users to study more.
